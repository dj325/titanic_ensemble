Current best score: 0.78947

This is a quick forray into the application of using a Random Forest to make survival predictions of a small (~O(10^3)) dataset.

The data is preprocessed and analysed in a Jupyter notebook. The model is chosen using grid search cross validation and then fit 
to the training data. There is some feature importance analsis at the end of this, which was fed back through to inform some of
the data analysis stages.
